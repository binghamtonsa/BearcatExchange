<h1>Common Questions</h1>
<h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
<p>Bearcat Exchange is completely free. Seriously, it&rsquo;s free.</p>
<h3>I&rsquo;m in a rush. How long will it take to get my textbook?</h3>
<p>Sellers are independent so we can&rsquo;t control how long they&rsquo;ll take, but they want your money and you want their textbook.</p>
<h3>Can I search for textbooks by course?</h3>
<p>Yep, you can search by any part of listings. Pro tip: You can also reorder results by clicking any column title.</p>
<h3>How do I remove my textbook?</h3>
<p>Click the link at the bottom of any message a buyer sent you. If you don&rsquo;t have any emails from buyers, you can click your textbook on the main page and send yourself a message.</p>
<h3>You asked for my name and email, but I don&rsquo;t want them on the internet...</h3>
<p>Your information is safe with us. When buyers contact you they can&rsquo;t see your email address because their message is sent through our server. A buyer will only see your email if you <i>reply</i> to their message to arrange a time to meet. If something seems odd, don&rsquo;t reply. Additionally, since the message goes through our server we filter spam before it&rsquo;s ever even sent! Best of all, once you mark your textbook as sold, no one else will be able to contact you, unlike normal email which stays in the wild forever.</p>
<h3>Will you send me unwanted messages?</h3>
<p>Nope, we only use your email to send alerts, such as when someone contacts you. You can also optionally subscribe to our super cool newsletter, which is only sent a few times a year and always has an unsubscribe link at the bottom.</p>
